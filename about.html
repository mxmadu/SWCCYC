            <p class="notification-header">There's a genocide happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo</h3>
            <p class="notification-content">For a final, I was asked to create an exhibit for a fictional interactive media gallery around the theme of connection,
                for which I found multiple relevant thematic threads in the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the DRC.<br>
                <br>
                The 'Green Revolution' has come at a terrible cost for Congolese men, women and children who have lost their homes, 
                their land and even their lives to the terrible violence being stoked by foreign governments with the aim of destabilizing the country and 
                extracting precious minerals found ins surplus in the country in order to meet the demands in the race to renewable energy.<br>
                <br>
            
                But this is not an African problem, it is a global problem. As consumers, we are all complicit 
                in the exploitation of Congolese people and the products we cling to for comfort and security is the 
                result of their subjugation. It is important for all of us to acknowledge this, to do what we can to support and uplift 
                the DRC and refuse to be complicit in this genocide.<br>
                <br>
                The minerals coming out of Congolese mines include cobalt, 
                tungsten, tin, coltan and many others that are integral to most modern day inventions such as smartphones, 
                wearable technology, electric-powered vehicles and vapes. Just because these minerals are central to technology 
                innovation, does not mean others must die for it.<br>
                <br>
                This project was made to raise awareness and also inspire you to take action. It is not enough that 
                we talk about the plight of the Congolese but we must do what we can to put an end to their suffering. 
                This includes holding onto our phones for longer or buying refurbished, recycling electronics, refusing to support brands 
                who buy from 'artisanal' mines, quitting vaping, and donating where possible. Visit Focus Congo and
                Friends of the Congo to learn about how you can get involved.<br>
                <br>
                Do not underestimate your power as a consumer and do not underestimate the echo of your voice.<br>
